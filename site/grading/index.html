<h2 id="online-discussions">Online Discussions</h2>
<p>The lecture part of this class will ask you to read the texts and discuss it online, before the next class. Weekly discussion topic and instructions will be announced on Canvas, and additional explanation will be provided in class. You can check the topic and submit your discussion posts and replies on Canvas. (Click Discussions in the navigation bar of Canvas page)</p>
<p>First, you are expected to submit your initial post by Monday every week. Your initial post should have more than 250 words, while following the instruction.</p>
<p>Then you will have two more days to leave <strong>two</strong> replies to others' posts, which is due on following Wednesday. Replies should have more than 100 words respectively.</p>
<p>A few select posts/replies may be introduced in class, with consideration of extra credits (i.e., honors point).</p>
<p>Discussion assignments will not be given on the 5th/10th week.</p>
<h2 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h2>
<p>This class gives majority of its focus on lab activities, supposed to be done individually, outside class. Lab assignments will be introduced in class, and due on a day before the next class. Hands-ons in class will be provided in a limited extent, due to skill disparities between students and time utilization's sake.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos with online resources will be provided, so that you can follow the instructions at your pace. As well, Slack community/instructor assist is available, so consider taking its full advantage.</p>
<p>Lab assignments will not be given on the 5th/10th week.</p>
<h2 id="projects-midtermfinal">Projects (Midterm/Final)</h2>
<p>As you read the Spolsky text, you will be asked to describe, discuss, and/or create or copy examples of a number of HCI principles. Your collection of descriptions and samples will be handed in twice during the quarter. This will also be submitted via Canvas.
<em> Part 1 – 5th week - Wednesday, February 6
</em> Part 2 – 10th week - Friday, March 15
* Late submissions will <strong>NOT</strong> be accepted after Friday, March 15.</p>
<h1 id="assignment-policies">Assignment Policies</h1>
<p>One learns to program by programming. That is why programming assignments are a significant portion of your grade in this class. We can discuss ideas, demonstrate how things work and, occasionally, try things out in class, but most of the actual "learning" and skill-building, especially when it comes to coding, will occur outside of class as you apply these concepts to assigned problems.</p>
<h2 id="submission-and-late-policy">Submission and Late Policy</h2>
<p>The following procedures apply to all assignments (unless specifically directed otherwise).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All assignments must be submitted via Canvas to be accepted</strong>. Each assignment will have a specified due date.<ul>
<li>Emailed assignments are not accepted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignments not turned in when they are due are considered late. Late assignments will receive a penalty depending on the number of days delayed:<ul>
<li>-10% for less than 1 day</li>
<li>-20% for less than 2 days</li>
<li>-30% for less than 3 days</li>
<li>-40% for less than 1 week</li>
<li>-50% for more than 1 week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Late submissions will <strong>NOT</strong> be accepted after Friday, March 15.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-challenge-and-late-submission">Technical Challenge and Late Submission</h3>
<p>Friendly Reminder: BE SURE TO ALWAYS BACK-UP YOUR WORK and store incremental copies in multiple places. Flash drives and personal laptops only fail just prior to the due date of programming assignments (or so it seems). The instructor is very unlikely to perceive a storage or system crash as adequate grounds for allowing an extension of a due date!</p>
<h2 id="general-assignment-policy">General Assignment Policy</h2>
<p><strong>All works are individual</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, all work is to be done on an <strong>individual basis</strong>. At the same time, it is understood that learning from your peers is valid and you are encouraged to talk among yourselves about programming in general and current assignments in particular. Keep in mind, however, that each individual student must do the work in order to learn. Hence, the following guidelines are established:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to discuss any and all programming assignments.<ul>
<li>Discussion on Slack in the class channel is encouraged, to share common pattern of troubleshooting experiences and to benefit from each other.</li>
<li>However, <strong>DO NOT</strong> allow other students to copy your code.</li>
<li>Given that said, <strong>DO NOT</strong> give any student an electronic or printed copy of any program you write for this class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaining the ability to properly analyze common programming errors is an important experience. <ul>
<li>Do not deprive (too early) a fellow student of his/her opportunity to practice problem solving: control the urge to show them what to do by writing the code for them.</li>
<li>If you don't know how to do it wisely, ask the instructor or lab tutors to do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you’ve given the assignment a fair effort and still need help, see the lab tutors or instructor.</li>
<li><strong>DOUBLE ZERO for plagiarism</strong>: If there is any evidence that a program or other written assignment was copied from another student, both students will earn 'double zero' credit for the assignment. <ul>
<li>That is, zero for the given assignment and another deduction of full credit amount of that assignment.</li>
<li>Following the university policy, the act will be automatically reported to department and dean's office.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protect yourself: Handle throw-away program listings carefully.</li>
</ul>
